API Integration Patterns
Error Handling

Graceful degradation to mock data
User-friendly error messages
Comprehensive logging
Network timeout handling

Authentication Flow

User login → JWT token received
Token stored in localStorage
Token included in API requests
Server validates token for protected routes

Payment Flow

User selects amount → Frontend creates order
Razorpay payment modal → User completes payment
Frontend verifies payment → Backend confirms transaction
Wallet balance updated → Success notification

Security Features
Backend Security

Helmet.js for security headers
CORS configuration
Rate limiting
Input validation with Joi
SQL injection prevention (Drizzle ORM)
XSS protection

Frontend Security

Input sanitization
Secure token storage
Route protection

Demo data fallback verification
Environment configuration validation

Development Tools

Debug API button (development only)
Comprehensive logging
Error boundary components
Network request monitoring

Deployment Considerations
Frontend Deployment

Static site hosting (Netlify/Vercel)
Environment variable configuration
Build optimization
PWA capabilities

Backend Deployment

Node.js hosting (Railway/Heroku/AWS)
Database hosting (Supabase/AWS RDS)
Environment variable security
Load balancing considerations
